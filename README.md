# AutomatedTesting

Testing is a crucial part of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). When people think about testing software, they often only think it is used to detect bugs in software. However, software testing is much more than detecting bugs, it is used to verify and validate the customerâ€™s requirements, and ensure software is efficient and secure. When writing and testing software one must understand the requirements and determine the logic needed for the implementation of said requirements. As well as ensure that proper coding techniques were followed during implementation through testing. Testing software can potentially stop defective and vulnerable software from being deployed that can cause a company and its customers to be at risk of attacks, data leaks/theft, damage to reputation, and financial losses. Therefore, it is important to test software, and focus on the implementation of the requirements.
